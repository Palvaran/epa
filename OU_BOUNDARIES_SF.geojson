Lark Waste Rock and Tailings (OU6) includes areas in and near the former town of Lark which were contaminated by wastes generated by mining activities in the vicinity.  Wastes included waste rock from digging the tunnels and shafts of the mines, tailings generated by several mills, and acid mine drainage discharged onto soils and into holding ponds.  The area covered by tailings was about 470 acres , waste rock was deposited on about 40 acres , and another 200 acres was affected by mine drainage.  It was estimated that there were about 5 million tons of tailings and 2 million tons of waste rock present on the site.  The site is transected by two intermittent streams, Midas Creek and Copper Creek, neither of which normally contain water.  Also present on the site is a small wetlands fed by a seep of moderately contaminated water.",
